# Pokemon Trading App
A Pokemon trading card application that allows users to search, store, and chat with others users. The app includes websockets using Node.js, Express and Socket.io with Vanilla JS on the frontend with a custom UI on the trade and chat pages. Other html pages are styled using the materiaize framework.

## Usage
```
npm install
npm run dev

Go to localhost:3000
```

## Notes
This repository was cloned from a different repo that allowed for the chat functionality to work successfully with our prior repository code. The initial repo can be found at https://github.com/Napolo-Sim/Project-2-Trading-Site . All prior commits have been saved in this repository, but the working application code is all within this new repository.
